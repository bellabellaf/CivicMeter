# CivicMeter: Decentralized Municipal Tax Collection Protocol

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, automated, and community-auditable tax collection and public fund allocation.

---

## 🧾 Overview

CivicMeter is a modular Clarity-based system designed to bring transparency and accountability to municipal tax systems. It enables fair taxation, real-time revenue tracking, compliance incentives, and community-powered auditing and disbursement—all without centralized intermediaries.

This system consists of ten core smart contracts:

1. **Registrar Contract** – Registers individuals, businesses, and tax agents
2. **Assessment Contract** – Calculates taxes owed based on declared or oracle-verified data
3. **StakerHub Contract** – Enables compliance staking and rewards timely taxpayers
4. **TaxToken Contract** – Token used for tax payments and rebates
5. **AuditVault Contract** – Manages anonymized tax data for decentralized auditing
6. **SpendingPool Contract** – Collects and allocates revenue toward community-approved budgets
7. **ProjectEscrow Contract** – Manages milestone-based fund releases for specific public projects
8. **DisputeResolution Contract** – Allows appeals and dispute voting
9. **DataOracleBridge Contract** – Integrates external data sources (e.g., sales, land, income)
10. **ComplianceNFT Contract** – Issues non-transferable NFTs representing taxpayer trust scores
